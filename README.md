# Credit_Scoring_Model
Using finance data form Kaggle set to Develop a credit scoring model to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical financial data. Utilize classification algorithms and assess the model's accuracy.

## Steps:
- Load and explore the dataset
- Preprocess the data
- Build and train the classification model
- Evaluate the model's performance
- Save the model for future use

## Step 1: Load and Explore the Dataset:
First, load the dataset and take a look at the first few rows to understand its structure.

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing:
- Identify the target variable: Assuming there is a column indicating creditworthiness (e.g., "Credit_Score" or similar).
- Handle missing values: Fill or drop missing values.
- Encode categorical variables: Convert categorical variables to numerical using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- Feature scaling: Scale numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale.

## Build and Train the Classification Model:
We will use a Random Forest classifier to build the credit scoring model. Let's train the model using the training data and evaluate its performance using the test data.
